    "**Making the Chatbot \"Remember\":**  \n",
    "When I built this chatbot, I added a simple memory feature: after each question, the chatbot keeps track of what I asked and the document pieces it found. If I ask a follow-up like, “What about debt?” right after “Tell me about infrastructure?”, it looks for cues in my wording (“what,” “about,” “tell me more”) and automatically links my given new question to the last thing I was discussing. This lets the chatbot connect the dots and keep the conversation flowing, so I don’t have to repeat Myself or restate the whole topic each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why I Set Up the Search This Way:**  \n",
    "For the search, I wanted the answers to be both accurate and easy to trace back to the source. Instead of just matching keywords, the chatbot uses what’s called semantic search: it compares my  question to all the sentences, bullet points, and tables pulled from the document, and finds the ones that really match what you mean—even if you phrase things differently. Each answer comes with a page and section reference, so I could know exactly where it is came from. This means I can trust the replies, and it’s especially helpful if im digging into long, complex documents where details matter."
